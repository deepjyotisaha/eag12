India will deepen direct humanitarian support to Afghanistan, considering requests raised by Muttaqi with Foreign Secretary Misri in Dubai on January 8, 2025. India attaches significance to the Jaishankar-Muttaqi conversation amid Muttaqi's upcoming visit to Iran and China. Discussions included cooperation on the Chabahar port, especially given India's ban on trade via Pakistan. Muttaqi's visit is part of Afghanistan's \"active foreign policy.\" Despite lacking formal recognition, India is willing to do \"whatever is necessary\" regarding the Taliban, increasing exchanges since the 2021 overthrow of President Ashraf Ghani's government.\n\nMore information is available at [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-make-a-bold-move-on-afghanistan/article69584396.ece).",

India will deepen direct humanitarian support to Afghanistan, considering requests raised by Muttaqi with Foreign Secretary Misri in Dubai on January 8, 2025. India attaches significance to the Jaishankar-Muttaqi conversation amid Muttaqi's upcoming visit to Iran and China. Discussions included cooperation on the Chabahar port, especially given India's ban on trade via Pakistan. Muttaqi's visit is part of Afghanistan's \"active foreign policy.\" Despite lacking formal recognition, India is willing to do \"whatever is necessary\" regarding the Taliban, increasing exchanges since the 2021 overthrow of President Ashraf Ghani's government.\n\nMore information is available at [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-make-a-bold-move-on-afghanistan/article69584396.ece).",
