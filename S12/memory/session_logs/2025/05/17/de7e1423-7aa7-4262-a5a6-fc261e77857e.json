The BMW 7 Series, while slightly more expensive initially, provides all-wheel drive, more horsepower, and a larger cargo space. However, the S-Class is deemed more reliable based on CARFAX data.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nQuery 2: What is the difference between the pricing in both of these cars?",
