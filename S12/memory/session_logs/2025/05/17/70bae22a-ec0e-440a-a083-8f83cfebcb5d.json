Unlike traditional AI programs, this curriculum focuses on designing browser-based agents that leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and multi-agent collaboration, preparing students to lead the development of next-generation AI solutions.\nThrough hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools like SmolAgents, LangChain, OpenAI Evals, Selenium/Playwright, and retrieval-augmented frameworks (RAGs), students rapidly progress from foundational concepts to real-world applications. The course emphasizes creating end-to-end systems, where AI agents autonomously browse, retrieve, and reason across diverse web-based contexts, all while ensuring state management, error correction, and optimal performance.\nFrom advanced prompt engineering and knowledge graphs to vision-based interaction and multi-modal AI systems, the curriculum is aligned with the latest trends in the industry.
