AI was a major area of the discussion, he said.\nAccording to the joint statement, Prime Minister Modi and President Macron stressed that nuclear energy is an essential part of the energy mix for strengthening energy security and transitioning towards a low-carbon economy. Both leaders acknowledged the India-France civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation with the Jaitapur nuclear power plant project.\nThey welcomed the first meeting of the Special Task Force on Civil Nuclear Energy, and welcomed the signing of a letter of intent on Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) and the Implementing Agreement between Indias GCNEP, DAE and Frances INSTN, CEA for cooperation in training and education of nuclear professionals, it stated.\nSMRs are compact nuclear fission reactors that can be manufactured in factories and then installed elsewhere. They have a smaller capacity than conventional nuclear reactors, and are seen as the future of civilian nuclear cooperation.\nGoing ahead from the AI Action summit in Paris, Prime Minister Modi and President Macron also launched an India-France Roadmap on Artificial Intelligence (AI), rooted in the philosophical convergence in their approaches focusing on the development of safe, open, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence.\nUnder the theme of Partnership for Security and Sovereignty, the two leaders recalled the deep and longstanding defence cooperation, and welcomed the continuation of the cooperation of air and maritime assets in line with the ambitious Defence Industrial Roadmap agreed in 2024.\nThe joint statement said that both leaders commended progress in collaboration in construction of Scorpene submarines in India, including indigenisation, and in particular the",

AI was a major area of the discussion, he said.\nAccording to the joint statement, Prime Minister Modi and President Macron stressed that nuclear energy is an essential part of the energy mix for strengthening energy security and transitioning towards a low-carbon economy. Both leaders acknowledged the India-France civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation with the Jaitapur nuclear power plant project.\nThey welcomed the first meeting of the Special Task Force on Civil Nuclear Energy, and welcomed the signing of a letter of intent on Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) and the Implementing Agreement between Indias GCNEP, DAE and Frances INSTN, CEA for cooperation in training and education of nuclear professionals, it stated.\nSMRs are compact nuclear fission reactors that can be manufactured in factories and then installed elsewhere. They have a smaller capacity than conventional nuclear reactors, and are seen as the future of civilian nuclear cooperation.\nGoing ahead from the AI Action summit in Paris, Prime Minister Modi and President Macron also launched an India-France Roadmap on Artificial Intelligence (AI), rooted in the philosophical convergence in their approaches focusing on the development of safe, open, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence.\nUnder the theme of Partnership for Security and Sovereignty, the two leaders recalled the deep and longstanding defence cooperation, and welcomed the continuation of the cooperation of air and maritime assets in line with the ambitious Defence Industrial Roadmap agreed in 2024.\nThe joint statement said that both leaders commended progress in collaboration in construction of Scorpene submarines in India, including indigenisation, and in particular the",

AI was a major area of the discussion, he said.\nAccording to the joint statement, Prime Minister Modi and President Macron stressed that nuclear energy is an essential part of the energy mix for strengthening energy security and transitioning towards a low-carbon economy. Both leaders acknowledged the India-France civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation with the Jaitapur nuclear power plant project.\nThey welcomed the first meeting of the Special Task Force on Civil Nuclear Energy, and welcomed the signing of a letter of intent on Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) and the Implementing Agreement between Indias GCNEP, DAE and Frances INSTN, CEA for cooperation in training and education of nuclear professionals, it stated.\nSMRs are compact nuclear fission reactors that can be manufactured in factories and then installed elsewhere. They have a smaller capacity than conventional nuclear reactors, and are seen as the future of civilian nuclear cooperation.\nGoing ahead from the AI Action summit in Paris, Prime Minister Modi and President Macron also launched an India-France Roadmap on Artificial Intelligence (AI), rooted in the philosophical convergence in their approaches focusing on the development of safe, open, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence.\nUnder the theme of Partnership for Security and Sovereignty, the two leaders recalled the deep and longstanding defence cooperation, and welcomed the continuation of the cooperation of air and maritime assets in line with the ambitious Defence Industrial Roadmap agreed in 2024.\nThe joint statement said that both leaders commended progress in collaboration in construction of Scorpene submarines in India, including indigenisation, and in particular the",
