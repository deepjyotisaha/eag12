The 5 Series has a wider, less vertical grille and a sleeker, more executive design, while the 7 Series has a prominent grille and a more limousine-like, blocky design. Both models offer fully electric (i5, i7) and plug-in hybrid versions. The 5 Series, like the 3 Series, is an executive saloon; the 7 Series is a limousine, often used for chauffeuring. Although both have similar boot sizes, the 7 Series offers more rear passenger space and luxury, especially with the 'Executive Pack' and BMW Theatre Screen (exclusive to 7 Series). While the 5 Series has the high-performance M5, the 7 Series has never had a full M version, but both have M60 xDrive and M70 xDrive options.",
