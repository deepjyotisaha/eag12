However, we ask authors to keep in mind two important criteria. First, we expect authors to document their methodology clearly for upholding scientific rigorousness and transparency standards. The use of LLMs in implementing the method should be described in the experimental setup section (or equivalent) if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the approach. The use of spell checkers and grammar suggestions, programming aid for editing purposes does not need to be documented. Second, authors are responsible for the entire content of the paper, including all text, figures, and references. Therefore, while authors are welcome to use any tool they wish for preparing and writing the paper, they must ensure that all content is correct and original.\nAll authors should take full responsibility to understand the advantages and limitations of using any tools and resources when preparing their scientific publications. Some (including free) tools may retain input data for further model training purposes, so authors should exercise caution to account for individual privacy considerations. High-level instructions could potentially result in hallucinations when generating plots, risking scientific integrity. It is the authors responsibility to verify the tools are used in a scientifically responsible manner.\nNeurIPS reserves the right to investigate at any time whether the Code of Conduct was adhered to, including after paper acceptance, publication, or the conference. If an investigation determines a violation, NeurIPS reserves the right to revoke the paper's publication status. Examples of such violations include content that is not scientifically sound (e.g. using references generated by an LLM without conducting the due diligence to verify correctness, existence and appropriateness in the manuscripts context)..\nFAQ\n1. Can I use Large Language Models (LLMs) while preparing my paper?\nYes, you are welcome to use any tool, including LLMs, to prepare for your publications. However, you must describe the use of these tools clearly if they are part of your methodology. If you use tools (including LLMs) for editing purposes (e.g. checking grammar), you do not need to declare it in your manuscript.\n2. If I used LLMs to help me prepare my manuscript, can I add it as one of the Authors?\nNo. Only humans are eligible to be authors. You, as an author, are fully responsible for all the content in your paper, including text, figures, and methodology, regardless of what tools (e.g., LLMs) you have used.
