Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Turkey in 1948, political and bilateral relations have been usually characterized by warmth and cordiality, although some sporadic tensions remain due to Turkey's support for Pakistan and India's continued support for Armenia, Greece and Cyprus against Turkey.[1][2] India has an embassy in Ankara and a consulategeneral in Istanbul. Turkey has an embassy in New Delhi and consulate-generals in Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. As of 2019, the bilateral trade between India and Turkey stood at US$7.8 billion.[3]\nHistory\n[edit]Economic and cultural relations between ancient India and Anatolia date back to the Vedic age (before 1500 BCE).[4]\nIn the Second Persian invasion of Greece, Indians were employed in the Achaemenid army of Xerxes. All troops were stationed in Sardis, Lydia, during the winter of 481-480 BCE to prepare for the invasion.[5][6] In the spring of 480 BCE \"Indian troops marched with Xerxes's army across the Hellespont\".[7][8]\nIn 1212, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum was gifted a colony in Koothanallur from the Chola Emperor of Tamilakam.[9] The first exchange of diplomatic missions between the Ottoman Sultans and the Muslim rulers of the sub-continent dates back to the years 148182. Ottoman expeditions to the sultanates of Gujarat, Bijapur, and Ahmednagar were motivated by mutual anti-Portuguese sentiment; Ottoman artillery contributed to the fall of the pro-Portuguese Vijayanagara Empire.[10] Turkish-Indian relations soured when the Mughals conquered most of India, since the Mughal Empire was a symbolic threat to the Ottoman Empire's position as the universal caliphate, despite contemplation for a Mughal-Ottoman-Uzbek alliance against Iran.[10][11] After the Mughal Empire collapsed, Muslim rulers of Mysore like Tipu Sultan sought Ottoman aid in driving out the British, but the Ottomans were weakened by wars with Russia and in no position to help.[12]\nFrom the 15th to the 19th century, Indian Dervishes came to the Ottoman Empire and built Tekke, the so-called Hintli Tekkeler. Their names are recorded in the Ottoman archives.[13][14] Their descendants are called \"Hindis\", especially in Istanbul where they have settled.[15]\nMore recently, the connection was increasingly fostered in the 19th and 20th centuries due to interactions between the two countries.[1] In 19121913, during the First Balkan War, Indian Muslim men in the Red Crescent Society of India cared for wounded Ottoman soldiers. They were led by Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari and Abdur Rahman Peshawari.[16][17] During World War I, the Briti",

Multiple diplomatic sources suggest India has privately conveyed opposition due to Turkeys close ties with Pakistan and contrasting views on regional security.\nAccording to a report published by RBC Ukraine, Indian diplomats have expressed that Turkeys bid contradicts the groups foundational focus on stability and consensus.\n- India fears Turkeys entry may inject friction into the groups functioning\n- Turkeys support for Pakistan, particularly on Kashmir, continues to be a red line for New Delhi\nThe Ministry of External Affairs has not issued an official statement yet, but former diplomats say a policy recalibration may be underway.\nTurkeys Defence Link with Pakistan Raises Red Flags\nAdding to Indias concerns is Ankaras military cooperation with Pakistan. Reports indicate Turkish cargo planes have recently delivered defence equipment to Pakistantriggering sharp reactions among Indian analysts and former officials.\nFormer Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal even suggested suspending flights to Turkey and boosting ties with Greece as a countermeasure.\nThis comes just days after the Pahalgam terror attack in India, raising public and political pressure to respond firmly to countries seen as supporting Pakistans security apparatus.\nTrade Continues Despite Diplomatic Setbacks\nInterestingly, bilateral trade between India and Turkey has remained relatively strong, reaching approximately $13.8 billion in FY 2022-23.\nTrade experts argue that economic interests on both sides could act as a stabilizing factor:\n- India exports automotive components, textiles, and machinery\n- Turkey sends chemicals, base metals, and electrical equipment to India\nHowever, analysts warn that prolonged diplomatic stress could spill into economic agreements if not managed with care.\nCultural Ties Offer a Thin Silver Lining\nCultural, academic, and civilizational links between India and Turkey remain strong. Initiatives in literature, cinema, and education exchanges have built goodwill over the decades.\nPublic diplomacy experts say these people-to-people connections could help keep some doors open even if official channels become strained.\nWhat Lies Ahead\nWith Turkey pushing aggressively for a bigger role in multilateral forums like BRICS and showing overt solidarity with Pakistan, India may recalibrate its approach.

          "text": "[trafilatura] NEW DELHI: India's trade relations with Turkey and Azerbaijan are facing new challenges after both countries voiced \"support for Pakistan\" and criticised New Delhi's recent strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\nTheir stance has sparked nationwide calls in India to boycott goods from Turkey and Azerbaijan and avoid traveling to these countries.\nOnline travel platforms like EaseMyTrip and Ixigo have also issued advisories urging people to avoid visiting Turkey and Azerbaijan. While MakeMy Trip has \"discontinued all promotions and offers on our platform to discourage tourism to these two destinations.\"\nOn the top of it, Indian traders have also started boycotting Turkish products such as apples and marbles.\nWhy are relations under strain?\nThe tensions began after Turkey and Azerbaijan openly condemned India's actions against terror infrastructure in Pakistan during its ongoing conflict, especially following '\nOperation Sindoor.'\nOperation Sindoor was launched on May 7, in response to the Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir on April 22, that claimed 26 lives. As part of the operation, India destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir.\nAzerbaijan's government released an official statement criticising India's military operation, raising concerns about civilian casualties and urging a diplomatic solution.\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry labelled India's airstrike as a \"provocative\" action and cautioned about the possibility of a major conflict. India has discovered that Pakistan is utilising Turkish-manufactured Asisguard Songar drones.\nPakistan's use of Turkish drones in attempts to target Indian military installations further added fuel to the fire. \"Our integrated air defence (AD) systems stood like a wall and they (Pakistan) could not breach it. Whether it's a Turkish drone or anything else, it fails in front of the technology of India,\" director general of air operations had earlier said in a briefing.\nWhat is the current state of trade between India, Turkey, and Azerbaijan?\nIndia's trade with both Turkey and Azerbaijan is relatively limited, but India enjoys a trade surplus with both.\nIndiaTurkey Trade: During April-February 2024-25, India's exports to Turkiye reached $5.2 billion, compared to $6.65 billion in 2023-24. This represents approximately 1.5% of India's total exports valued at $437 billion.\nFor the same period, India's imports from Turkiye amounted to $2.84 billion, down from $3.78 billion in 2023-24. This constitutes roughly 0.5% of India's total imports of $720 billion.\nIndiaAzerbaijan Trade: India imported goods worth $2.84 billion from Turkiye between April and February 2024-25, down from $3.78 billion in 2023-24. This makes up about 0.5% of Indias total imports of $720 billion.\nIndia's exports to Azerbaijan registered $86.07 million during April-February 2024-25, slightly lower than $89.67 million in 2023-24. This amounts to just 0.02% of India's overall exports.\nWhat products are ",

Multiple diplomatic sources suggest India has privately conveyed opposition due to Turkeys close ties with Pakistan and contrasting views on regional security.\nAccording to a report published by RBC Ukraine, Indian diplomats have expressed that Turkeys bid contradicts the groups foundational focus on stability and consensus.\n- India fears Turkeys entry may inject friction into the groups functioning\n- Turkeys support for Pakistan, particularly on Kashmir, continues to be a red line for New Delhi\nThe Ministry of External Affairs has not issued an official statement yet, but former diplomats say a policy recalibration may be underway.\nTurkeys Defence Link with Pakistan Raises Red Flags\nAdding to Indias concerns is Ankaras military cooperation with Pakistan. Reports indicate Turkish cargo planes have recently delivered defence equipment to Pakistantriggering sharp reactions among Indian analysts and former officials.\nFormer Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal even suggested suspending flights to Turkey and boosting ties with Greece as a countermeasure.\nThis comes just days after the Pahalgam terror attack in India, raising public and political pressure to respond firmly to countries seen as supporting Pakistans security apparatus.\nTrade Continues Despite Diplomatic Setbacks\nInterestingly, bilateral trade between India and Turkey has remained relatively strong, reaching approximately $13.8 billion in FY 2022-23.\nTrade experts argue that economic interests on both sides could act as a stabilizing factor:\n- India exports automotive components, textiles, and machinery\n- Turkey sends chemicals, base metals, and electrical equipment to India\nHowever, analysts warn that prolonged diplomatic stress could spill into economic agreements if not managed with care.\nCultural Ties Offer a Thin Silver Lining\nCultural, academic, and civilizational links between India and Turkey remain strong. Initiatives in literature, cinema, and education exchanges have built goodwill over the decades.\nPublic diplomacy experts say these people-to-people connections could help keep some doors open even if official channels become strained.\nWhat Lies Ahead\nWith Turkey pushing aggressively for a bigger role in multilateral forums like BRICS and showing overt solidarity with Pakistan, India may recalibrate its approach. Strategic analysts suggest India cou",

While MakeMy Trip has \"discontinued all promotions and offers on our platform to discourage tourism to these two destinations.\"\nOn the top of it, Indian traders have also started boycotting Turkish products such as apples and marbles.\nWhy are relations under strain?\nThe tensions began after Turkey and Azerbaijan openly condemned India's actions against terror infrastructure in Pakistan during its ongoing conflict, especially following '\nOperation Sindoor.'\nOperation Sindoor was launched on May 7, in response to the Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir on April 22, that claimed 26 lives. As part of the operation, India destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir.\nAzerbaijan's government released an official statement criticising India's military operation, raising concerns about civilian casualties and urging a diplomatic solution.\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry labelled India's airstrike as a \"provocative\" action and cautioned about the possibility of a major conflict. India has discovered that Pakistan is utilising Turkish-manufactured Asisguard Songar drones.\nPakistan's use of Turkish drones in attempts to target Indian military installations further added fuel to the fire. \"Our integrated air defence (AD) systems stood like a wall and they (Pakistan) could not breach it. Whether it's a Turkish drone or anything else, it fails in front of the technology of India,\" director general of air operations had earlier said in a briefing.\nWhat is the current state of trade between India, Turkey, and Azerbaijan?\nIndia's trade with both Turkey and Azerbaijan is relatively limited, but India enjoys a trade surplus with both.\nIndiaTurkey Trade: During April-February 2024-25, India's exports to Turkiye reached $5.2 billion, compared to $6.65 billion in 2023-24. This represents approximately 1.5% of India's total exports valued at $437 billion.\nFor the same period, India's imports from Turkiye amounted to $2.84 billion, down from $3.78 billion in 2023-24. This constitutes roughly 0.5% of India's total imports of $720 billion.\nIndiaAzerbaijan Trade: India imported goods worth $2.84 billion from Turkiye between April and February 2024-25, down from $3.78 billion in 2023-24. This makes up about 0.5% of Indias total imports of $720 billion.\nIndia's exports to Azerbaijan registered $86.07 million during April-February 2024-25, slightly lower than $89.67 million in 2023-24. This amounts to just 0.02% of India's overall exports.\nWhat products are ",
