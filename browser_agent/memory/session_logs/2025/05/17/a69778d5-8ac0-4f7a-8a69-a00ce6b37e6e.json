Through courses like ERA, EMLO, EPAi, and EAG, TSAI has trained over 7000 students. The EAG course is a comprehensive program designed to equip students with the skills to build advanced AI agents capable of autonomous decision-making and interaction within complex web environments, using tools like SmolAgents, LangChain, and OpenAI Evals. The curriculum emphasizes real-world applications and the creation of end-to-end systems, with a capstone project challenging students to design a fully autonomous browser assistant.\nQuery 2: Give me the list of our solar planets in a table including distance from earth and their diameters in markdown table format.",

Our solar system is usually gone over in elementary school, so you might just need a refresher course about the planets in order in our solar system. Check out this guide to learn all about the planets, their size, and their order in the solar system.\nWithout Jupiter cleaning out the early solar system, the Earth would be pock-marked with meteor collisions. We would suffer from asteroid impacts every day. CNN studios would probably be a gigantic crater it if wasnt for Jupiter.  Michio Kaku\nOur Solar Systems Planets in Order\nOur solar system revolves around the sun, hence the name solar system. In our system, we have 4 terrestrial planets, 4 gas giants, and a mysterious 9th planet. Lets go over them, but first, heres a quick rundown of each planet in order of size and distance from the sun.\nPlanets In Order Of Size:\n| Planet | Diameter (km) | Size relative to Earth |\n| Mercury | 4879.4 | 38% the size of Earth |\n| Mars | 6779 | 53% the size of Earth |\n| Venus | 12104 | 95% the size of Earth |\n| Earth | 12756 | 100% the size of Earth |\n| Neptune | 49528 | 388% the size of Earth |\n| Uranus | 51118 | 400% the size of Earth |\n| Saturn | 120660 | 945% the size of Earth |\n| Jupiter | 142800 | 1120% the size of Earth |\nPlanets in order of distance from the Sun:\n| Planet | Distance from the Sun (AU/KM) |\n| Mercury | 0.39 (57.9 million) |\n| Venus | 0.723 (108.2 million) |\n| Earth | 1 (149.6 million) |\n| Mars | 1.524 (227.9 million) |\n| Jupiter | 5.203 (778.3 million) |\n| Saturn | 9.539 (1,427.0 million) |\n| Uranus | 19.18 (2,871 million) |\n| Neptune | 30.06 (4,497.1 million) |\nPlanets In Order Of Mass:\n| Planet | Mass (kg) |\n| Jupiter | 1.8986 x 1027 |\n| Saturn | 5.6846 x 1026 |\n| Neptune | 10.243 x 1025 |\n| Uranus | 8.6810 x 1025 |\n| Earth | 5.9736 x 1024 |\n| Venus | 4.8685 x 1024 |\n| Mars | 6.4185 x 1023 |\n| Mercury | 3.3022 x 1023 |\nThe Terrestrial Planets In Order\n1. Mercury\nThe first planet in our solar system is Mercury. It is slightly smaller than Earths moon and is extremely hot. As in 850 Fahrenheit or so. NASA launched the MESSENGER probe in 2004 to learn all about Mercury since we dont really know much about it.\nFacts:\n- Orbit time: 88 Earth days\n- 1 day on Mercury is 59 Earth days\n- Has a diameter of a little over 3,000 miles\n2. Venus\nVenus is the second planet in our solar system and is named after the Roman goddess of love. Venus is actually hotter than Mercury and is abundant in greenhouse gasses. Venus is similar to Earth in size and general structure. The Soviet Union sent the probes in the Venera series to learn more about Venus that helped us learn a bit about Venus atmosphere, and Venera probes are actually the first manmade devices to enter another planets atmosphere.
