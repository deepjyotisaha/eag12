Other than these facts firmware and device drivers have some major differences. The table below shows the main differences between Firmware and Device drivers.\n| Firmware | Device Drivers |\n| Firmware is a class of software that is written for specific custom hardware. | Device drivers are software that is needed to make a given hardware accessory work within a given operating system. Device drivers are tightly connected with and controlled by the operating system. |\n| Firmware lives and runs directly on the hardware. | Device drivers live on the hard-disk. |\n| Firmware is independent of an operating system, i.e you can run any operating system on top of a given motherboards firmware. | Device drivers are highly dependent on the operating system on which they are used. For example, for the same hardware device, you need different device drivers for using that on Windows vs Linux. |\n| Firmware cannot be updated through an operating system, we need to go into the BIOS/UEFI to update the device drivers | Drivers can be updated from within the operating system. |\n| Firmware engineers do not need any knowledge of operating systems. But they need core knowledge on processors and the latest RAMs, PCIe standards, and so on to write firmware that complies with the latest standards | Device driver engineers need knowledge about the specific device that they are using, the communication standard the device uses to talk to the computer (like Bluetooth, USB, etc), and the operating system the device driver is written for. |\n| Firmware is written by motherboard manufacturers | Drivers are written by engineers in companies that produce hardware accessories that connect to your computer |\n| Examples include the BIOS/UEFI interface that comes with the computers motherboard | Examples include spe",

        "text": "[trafilatura] Difference Between Device Driver and Firmware\nA typical computer consists of hardware, software and firmware. These components work together to make the computer work in a way its designed to work. Hardware is any physical device that you can actually see and touch, whether internal to the computer or external devices attached to the computer. We use numerous hardware devices with a computer, such as printer, scanner, mice, keyboard, monitor, disk drive, audio card, video card, and modem are all examples of hardware devices. Software is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to work and execute specific tasks. Unlike hardware which describes the physical aspects of a computer, software is anything that can be stored electronically and its an immaterial part that runs a computer. Device drivers are also software. Firmware is also software, but programmed on a hardware device.\nWhat is a Device Driver?\nDevice driver is a particular type of software program that enable hardware devices to interact with each other. It is a software application that acts as an intermediary between a piece of hardware and an application or the operating system. A computer operates a great many kinds of devices, most of which fit into the general category of storage devices, transmission devices, and human-interface devices. A device communicates with a computer system through its associated device driver. So, a device driver communicates with the hardware device via a connection point, or port  for example, a serial port. Device drivers are specific to operating system which allow the kernel of the OS to communicate with hardware devices, without worrying about the details of how they actually work. A device driver presents a uniform device-access interface to the I/O subsystem, much like the system calls which provide a standard interface between the application program and the operating system.\nWhat is a Firmware?\nFirmware is a set of instructions programmed into a hardware device, typically in non-volatile memory such as read-only memory or flash memory. Firmware is a special form of software that enables a device to perform functions without the need of installing additional software. It refers to computer programs and data loaded into a class of memory that cannot be dynamically modified by the computer during processing. Firmware includes the internal set of instructions used by a hardware device for initiation and operation, often encoded in non-volatile memory. A basic input output system (BIOS) chip is a common example of a firmware. The computer programs and data contained in firmware are classified as software. Firmware is typically stored in the read-only memory of a hardware device, and can be erased and rewritten. Firmware updates often require specialized standalone applications, custom boot mechanisms, and require extensive research as each vendor provides one or more versions of firmware updates for its device.\nDifference between Device Driver",
