As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the\nDelhi Development Authority\n, in the district of\nGurgaon\n, and in the adjacent state of\nHaryana\n. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their\nDLF City\nproject at\nGurgaon\n. This included hotels,\ninfrastructure\n, and\nspecial economic zones\n-related development projects.\nT",
