A ceasefire was brokered by the U.S., according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but India accused Pakistan of violating it. Experts, like Col. Stephen Ganyard, emphasize the danger due to both countries possessing nuclear weapons. The conflict is rooted in the 1947 independence and centers on Kashmir, according to Surupa Gupta, professor at the University of Mary Washington.",

India launched strikes targeting \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to an April attack that killed 26 Hindu tourists in India-administered Kashmir. India said at least 5 military personnel and 16 civilians died in the clashes. After tit-for-tat missile and drone strikes, a US-brokered ceasefire appears to be holding. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India has only \"paused\" its military action. India's Air Chief Marshal AK Bharti said India's fight was \"with terrorists\".",
